# Building code and running the application

The SkywardAI Chat backend is a Python-based application that uses the FastAPI framework to provide a RESTful API for the SkywardAI Chat frontend. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the backend on your local machine.


## Prerequisites

Please install Docker and Docker Compose on your machine before proceeding. You can find installation instructions for Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).


## Step 1: Clone the repository

First, clone the SkywardAI Chat repository to your local machine by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SkywardAI/chat-backend.git
```

## Step 2: Navigate to the project directory

Change into the project directory by running the following command:

```bash
cd chat-backend
```

{: .warning }

> Please go to check the latest version of frontend in the [releases](https://github.com/SkywardAI/chat-frontend/pkgs/container/rebel), and update it in docker-compose.yml file in [here](https://github.com/SkywardAI/chat-backend/blob/f73fff482b64cc45bde89fb5e7b4a8e5d1789481/docker-compose.yaml#L138).


## Step 3: Build and run the images

Setting up environment variables for the backend by creating a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. You can use the following template to create the `.env` file:

```
make up
```

```bash

vscode ➜ /workspaces/chat-backend (main) $ make up

Here we install tons of dependencies more detail see [requirements.txt](https://github.com/SkywardAI/chat-backend/blob/main/backend/requirements.txt), so it may take a while to build the image.

## Step 4: Verify the setup

You can verify that the backend is running correctly by visiting the following URL in your browser:

```
http://localhost:80/
```

## Stopping the Docker container

If you need to stop the Docker container for any reason, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
make stop
```

```bash
vscode ➜ /workspaces/chat-backend (main) $ make stop
[+] Stopping 7/7
 ✔ Container milvus-standalone  Stopped          0.2s 
 ✔ Container frontend           Stopped          0.2s 
 ✔ Container db_editor          Stopped          0.1s 
 ✔ Container backend_app        Stopped          10.1s 
 ✔ Container milvus-etcd        Stopped          0.1s 
 ✔ Container milvus-minio       Stopped          0.6s 
 ✔ Container db                 Stopped          0.1s
```


This will stop the backend container and clean up any resources that were created during the setup process. You can only stop the containers by using

```bash
make remove
```


```bash
vscode ➜ /workspaces/chat-backend (main) $ make remove
[+] Running 7/6
 ✔ Container backend_app         Removed         10.1s 
 ✔ Container milvus-standalone   Removed         0.0s 
 ✔ Container db_editor           Removed         0.1s 
 ✔ Container milvus-etcd         Removed         0.0s 
 ✔ Container milvus-minio        Removed         0.0s 
 ✔ Container db                  Removed         0.1s 
 ✔ Network chat-backend_default  Removed         0.0s
```


# Troubleshooting

## Checking the logs

If you encounter any issues while setting up the backend, you can check the logs by running the following command:

```bash
make logs
```

This will display the logs for the backend container and help you identify any errors that may have occurred during the setup process.
